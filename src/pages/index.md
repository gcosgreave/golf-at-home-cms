  title: Looking for golf lessons or want to learn to play in the comfort of your
    own home?
  description: >
    How many of you have actually visited your local instructor, understood
    exactly what they were teaching, applied that to your game and got real
    results, or would feel intimidated/exposed on a golf Driving Range?


    Quite often the driving range can be a daunting experience for many, which is one of the reasons why we provide this unique completely private service, tailored individually for your needs. 


    Home tuition produces greater results. Results that are achieved through teaching into nets in the comfort of your own surroundings. This allows us to focus solely on your swing, creating a golf swing adapted to your ability, and in turn you’ll strike straighter balls, feeling relaxed and confident for that all important first shot off tee. 


    Our passion, just like yours is golf and we cater for all ages and abilities. Our affordable service also means that you and a partner, friend or family member also needing a lesson can share it within our one hour lesson at no extra cost.


    Don’t forget it’s private so no one else needs to know!


    All lessons can be booked via our Mobile App, just look for Golf at Home on the App Store and download for free. You’ll also find some amazing information on the App and some ‘coming soon’ features as well.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
